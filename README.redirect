gatling can do HTTP redirects.

To do it, create a symlink like this:

  $ ln -s http://www.google.com/ search.html

Then, if someone tries to access search.html via HTTP, gatling will
detect the special broken symlink and send the user a HTTP redirect to
www.google.com.

To redirect an URL ending in /, create that directory and create a
symlink as above for index.html.
