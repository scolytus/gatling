gatling now has primitive SSL/TLS support using OpenSSL.
I took the code from the excellent qmail STARTTLS patch.
No support for much of anything yet, you just get an HTTPS server
using the certificate in "server.pem" in the gatling root directory.

If you want OpenSSL to verify client certs, put the CA cert in
"clientca.pem".  If you need a revocation list, use OpenSSL 0.9.7 or
later, and put it in "clientcrl.pem".

No way to communicate anything about the client cert to CGIs yet.
