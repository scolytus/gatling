This is an experimental web server, meant to demonstrate how to write a
scalable web server using the IO and IOB API from libowfat
(http://www.fefe.de/libowfat/).

To compile this, you will need the current libowfat version, probably
even the current CVS version.

Read the README.* files and visit the project page at
http://www.fefe.de/gatling/ for further information.
